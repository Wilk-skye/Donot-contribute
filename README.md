# Donot-contribute to linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes

I invited you to this repo to let you know that the owner of this repo 
https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes where you are a contributor is using your efforts to sell courses on Udemy and earn through sponsors. Even I'm a contributor and felt that my efforts must be made available to other for free instead of owner of the repo filling his pockets.


# Lets discuss in the discord.
